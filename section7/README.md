# WebServer - HTTP - EXPRESS - HBS

In this section i played with some node features and new packages like `handlebars`.

To be honest, i like so much `handlebars` i see great potential.

The original course does a deployment in railway.app & heroku, but i didn't implemente it because i know how to do it in my raspberry and also using `pm2`, that is more useful than `nodemon`.

The template is not from my authority.
